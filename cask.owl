The set on which the permutation acts is not specified. To this end,
cycles of length 0 or 1 do not occur in permutations.

When viewed as the set of cycles which are its arguments, the symbol
permutation has a normal form constructor.

All symbols defined in this CD may appear as the head of an
application.  For such symbols, we distinguish between functions and
constructors.  A function is thought of as a mathematical function,
which can be evaluated on its arguments, a constructor uses its
arguments as fields of a structure. (In principle, the arguments of a constructor should
be accessible; we have not introduced separate symbols to enable
access because the `destruction' of the mathematical object can take place in phrasebooks.)

The constructors in this CD are cycle, permutation, list_perm, and endomap.

The operations inverse, left_compose, right_compose are also defined
in this CD, although the most general purpose version already occurs
in fns1, fns2. The reasons is two-fold: first, strictly
speaking, our permutations are not maps, and so these notions havfe to
redefined.  A more practical reason is that with dynamical loading, it
is easier to encode and decode a new symbol in the CD at hand rather
than a symbol in a CD that is previously dealt with.

Revision 0.2: added endomap. Help of Henny Wilbrink.""" ;

 polynomials. There are many possible choices for a polynomial CD, and
 several questions to answer. 

 The reader may feel that this content dictionary is quite different in
 spirit from the \"Basic\" one. Although it basically defines a set of concepts
 related to polynomials (such as degree, factorization, resultant...), there
 are two new points here:
 - a certain emphasis on representation issues (including structural
   constraints on some OM objects),
 - an attempt to specify some \"computational behaviour\" of an OM application
   that handles (part of) this CD.
 
 As some people may disagree with some of our choices, we will try to justify
 them in this rather long foreword. 
 
 1. Representation issues

 One of the interest of OM is certainly to enable the use of specialized
 servers. It is important to promote the writing of OM-compliant servers by
 placing as few constraints as possible on the programmers of these
 packages. This CD has been designed with the idea that it could be simple to
 use for a server dealing only with polynomial computations. Hence we have
 used a particular representation for polynomials (distributed with dense
 monomials). This representation is rather abstract in the sense that it does
 not introduce names for variables. It explicitly contains the polynomial
 ring a polynomial belongs to as the set of the coefficients and the number
 of variables. It seems (from our experience) that this information is
 necessary for most specialized servers. 

 Expressing constraints on the structure of OM objects made from the symbols
 in this CD is not always easy. One of the main reason is that a symbol such
 as \"gcd\" is meant to denote the GCD of a set of polynomials, no matter how
 the polynomials are represented. Such a function should thus accept both
 \"symbolic\" arguments (a list of symbolic object meant to be polynomials) and
 the polynomials in the specific representation defined in this CD. Of
 course, another solution will be to have one \"gcd\" for one (or several)
 particular representation and another \"gcd\" to express the general notion
 of polynomial \"gcd\". We though that the solution we chose was more in the
 spirit of \"Basic\" and the discussions of the last OpenMath meeting.

 A question which is not entirely answered is whether or not it is
 interesting to have \"symbolic\" objects inside some constructors (such as a
 power which is not an OM integer in \"Monom\" or a symbolic \"PolyRingD\" (a
 variable) as an argument of \"DMP\"). We explicitly forbid that in the first
 version of this CD.

 Note that we did not try to express the constraints with signatures in this
 version because we did not find a really satisfactory solution.

 2. Specifying some \"computational behaviour\"

 Of course it would be of no use to exactly specify the behaviour of any OM
 application that receives an OM object. There are (at least) two reasons for
 that:
 - an OM object is intended to represent a mathematical object and thus the
   same OM object could be sent to a typesetter as well as to a symbolic
   computation system,
 - even when dealing with programs that compute, exact specifications could be
   impossible or too much constraining for a given system.

 On the other hand, we believe that one of the goal of OM is certainly that a
 program needing to factorize an integer could transparently use Maple, Axiom
 or Pari to do the job. This is of course possible only if all severs that
 \"implement\" (in the sense of really performing) the mathematical notion of
 integer factorization answer in a similar way. In other words, we should not
 hesitate to specify what a particulary useful class of OM applications (the
 \"computing\" ones) should return (the form of the result) everytime
 compliance to this specification is simple enough because it is obviously
 very useful. We have tried to express this idea in this CD through some
 comments and the use of symbols such as \"factored\" or \"groebnered\" that
 describe the required results of some functions. 
 
 The general \"compliance\" rule can be stated as:
   an OM application that understands this CD and implements some of the 
   polynomials operation described is required to implement them using the
   constructors defined in this CD, as indicated in the comments associated
   with the operations.

 This means that if the OM version of a computer algebra system claims to
 implement polynomial factorization, another application can send him an
 OM object as described in the \"factor\" comment (the symbol \"factor\" applied
 to one argument, a DMP) and the result will be return as defined : a 
 \"factored\" symbol whose arguments are described in the corresponding entry
 of the poly CD.""" ,

                                                 """This is our attempt at defining a first Content Dictionary to deal with
 polynomials. There are many possible choices for a polynomial CD, and
 several questions to answer. 


 1. Representation issues

 One of the interests of OM is certainly to enable the use of specialized
 servers. It is important to promote the writing of OM-compliant servers by
 placing as few constraints as possible on the programmers of these
 packages. This CD has been designed with the idea that it could be simple to
 use for a server dealing only with polynomial computations. Hence we have
 used a particular representation for polynomials (distributed with dense
 monomials). This representation is rather abstract in the sense that it does
 not introduce names for variables. It explicitly contains the polynomial
 ring a polynomial belongs to as the set of the coefficients and the number
 of variables. It seems (from our experience) that this information is
 necessary for most specialized servers. 

 Expressing constraints on the structure of OM objects made from the symbols
 in this CD is not always easy. One of the main reason is that a symbol such
 as \"gcd\" is meant to denote the GCD of a set of polynomials, no matter how
 the polynomials are represented. Such a function should thus accept both
 \"symbolic\" arguments (a list of symbolic object meant to be polynomials) and
 the polynomials in the specific representation defined in this CD. Of
 course, another solution will be to have one \"gcd\" for one (or several)
 particular representation and another \"gcd\" to express the general notion
 of polynomial \"gcd\". 

 A question which is not entirely answered is whether or not it is
 interesting to have \"symbolic\" objects inside some constructors (such as a
 power which is not an OM integer in \"Monom\" or a symbolic \"poly_ring_d\" (a
 variable) as an argument of \"DMP\"). We explicitly forbid that in the first
 version of this CD.


 2. Specifying some \"computational behaviour\"

 Of course it would be of no use to exactly specify the behaviour of any OM
 application that receives an OM object. There are (at least) two reasons for
 that:
 - an OM object is intended to represent a mathematical object and thus the
   same OM object could be sent to a typesetter as well as to a symbolic
   computation system,
 - even when dealing with programs that compute, exact specifications could be
   impossible or too much constraining for a given system.

 On the other hand, we believe that one of the goals of OM is certainly that a
 program needing to factorize an integer could transparently use Maple, Axiom
 or Pari to do the job. This is of course possible only if all severs that
 \"implement\" (in the sense of really performing) the mathematical notion of
 integer factorization answer in a similar way. In other words, we should not
 hesitate to specify what a particulary useful class of OM applications (the
 \"computing\" ones) should return (the form of the result) everytime
 compliance to this specification is simple enough because it is obviously
 very useful. 

We have tried to express this idea in the polydx CDs through some
 comments and the use of symbols such as \"factored\" or \"groebner_basis\" that
 describe the required results of some functions. 

 The general \"compliance\" rule can be stated as:
   an OM application that understands this CD and implements some of the 
   polynomials operation described is required to implement them using the
   constructors defined in this CD, as indicated in the comments associated
   with the operations.

 This means that if the OM version of a computer algebra system claims to
 implement polynomial factorization, another application can send him an
 OM object as described in the \"factor\" comment (the symbol \"factor\" applied
 to one argument, a DMP) and the result will be return as defined: a 
 \"factored\" symbol whose arguments are described in the corresponding entry
 of the poly CD.""" .

Before defining which of the possible

are taken in {0, ..., p-1}, the indeterminate is X.  Let g(X) =

Remainder Theorem, see W. Nickel, <em>Endliche Koerper in dem

Conway polynomials were defined by R. Parker. Their purpose is to
provide a standard notation for elements in a finite field
GF(p^n) with p^n elements, p being a prime.

This is for example used within computer algebra systems to have data
of finite field elements which can easily be ported between different
programs.
 
The Conway polynomials are also used in data bases like the Modular
Atlas character tables, this was the original motivation for their
definition.
 
The computation method of computing the minimal polynomials of all
compatible elements was rediscovered in

L.S.Heath and N.A.Loehr, <em>New algorithms for generating Conway
polynomials over finite fields</em>, Proceedings of the Tenth Annual
ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (Baltimore, MD, 1999),
429--437, ACM, New York (1999)

There are basically two methods to compute Conway polynomials.

The first is to run through all polynomials of degree n over GF(p)
with respect to the ordering defined above and to check the necessary
conditions (for primitivity one has to check that for each proper
(maximal) divisor k of p^n-1 we have that f_{p,n}(X)
does not divide X^k-1).

The second possibility is to take any representation of
GF(p^n) and to enumerate all elements in that field which
fulfill the compatibility condition 3. above. Then check for each of
these elements if it is primitive and if yes compute its minimal
polynomial over GF(p). The smallest polynomial found this way is the
Conway polynomial.

Both methods were used by R. Parker to compute a long list of Conway
polynomials. These are available in computer algebra systems like <a
href=\"http://www.gap-system.org\">GAP</a> or <a
href=\"http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/u/magma/\">Magma</a> and they
are used in several other programs, like the <a

the pi are precisely the primes which divide the order of 
some centralizer of a conjugacy class

* centralizer_indices is of the form
